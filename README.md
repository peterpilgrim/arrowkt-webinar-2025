Webinar: Taming Complexity: Functional Error Handling with Arrow.kt November 2025

November 2025

I presented this show as an impromptu event. Admittedly, it was disastrous. 
So I re-recorded the webinar with my own studio kit.
This final presentation slide deck can be found the [documents sub folder](src/docs)
